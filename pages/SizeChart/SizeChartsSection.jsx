Sourcing's Apparel Size Guide- You no longer need to order the next size up! First things first: get adequately
measured for your body, including your chest, waist, hips, and inseam. The Fashion Brands Size Chart
describes how to take body measurements properly. For the most accurate testing, use light-weight clothing
or a naked body (recommended size). Then refer to our Size Recommendations to get the correct
measurement of the shorts you’d like to purchase. That way, every garment fits and feels as if it were made
just for you. Clothes for Women: Consult our size chart based on your particular body type, apparel, or
fashion company when purchasing an individual item or a set of the same item.`,

the office, our sizing information will help you get the right fit for each recipient. We provide a full-size
range to fit all body types. We understand that orders aren’t always standard, which is why a one-size-fits-
all approach doesn’t work for everyone when you’re asking for large orders—not one SKU—at a time. This
means they can all be adjusted individually to suit, ensuring a perfect fit for both comfort and style.
Consulting our garment sizing guide gives you peace of mind, knowing every piece that comes into your
store matches the sizes your clients wear. For workwear, team wear, or promotional wear, every order is
made to measure and tailored to fit.`,

We get that fitting can be a problem when buying custom clothes. To help guarantee you are in the correct size, please
refer to our sizing guides to prevent fitting issues. One of the most common mistakes is buying the wrong size, simply
because you provided us with incorrect measurements. To avoid this problem, merely refer to our official size chart
for guidance on making the best choice for your body, considering your chest, waist, hips, and inseam measurements.
Another common problem is ordering clothes that are too big or too small. To ensure a proper fit, please check the
size information provided before ordering. This will help you select the correct size chart for your clothes, taking into
account the detailed style of the shirts. If you determine fit is not the correct size even after consulting with our staff,
consider bumping up to custom singlets for a more tailored fit. Aaryan Sourcing takes care of all your size problems
and makes sure you get a perfect fit.`,
